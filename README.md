# Game description
At the start of the game the hero appears on the Starting Map in the middle of the world without a weapon, which can be acquired in the cave placed
on the same map. Having the sword, the hero can now face 5 different types of mobs, which are deployed around the world. Every mob after its death drops loot on the ground in the form of gold, bomb or heart. There are two hidden caves - on the east and south west maps, which can be uncovered by exploding bomb nearby the hidden cave entrance. In the cave on the east map the player can choose one from two laying items to pick for free, whereas in the south west cave the player can buy one from three laying items if he or she has enough gold collected from mobs. When the number of hearts on the health bar drops down to 0, the player loses the game. If the player manages to defeat the final boss, the game ends by player's victory.
